## Less is More

Humanity makes progress by doing more with less. I believe reducing code size is the fundamental goal of any programming language. If you didn't care about code size, you'd just write your code in assembly.

Doing more with less is the first principle of design and foundation of just about every good programming practice: [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [ZEN (YAGNI)](http://www.essenceandartifact.com/2016/02/yagni-and-building-in-house-frameworks.html), [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), [interface segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle), etc... That's why I wrote CaffeineScript. This info-graphic shows the result:

## Project Status (updated October, 2024)

I've been using CaffeineScript in production since 2016. Though I do a lot of TypeScript for my day job, CaffeineScript is still my language of choice for projects when I have final say. It really is dramatically faster to develop in compared to JS or TS. I've learned a lot and the language has evolved significantly since then.

I'd love to hear from anyone who's interested in using CaffeineScript. I'm really the only one right now, but I LOVE it, and I think you will too.
